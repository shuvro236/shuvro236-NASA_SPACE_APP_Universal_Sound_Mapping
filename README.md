# shuvro236-NASA_SPACE_APP_Universal_Sound_Mapping
This is for the NASA Space App Challenge. I want to make a learning platform where not only general learners can learn about space but also visually impaired learners can learn about space. I plan to merge the visual and auditory like I give a sound node for every planet according to their characteristics and all the nodes make a composition.


Introduction
Our project, Universal Sound Mapping: Exploring the Cosmos Through Music, is designed to make space learning accessible and engaging for everyone, regardless of their visual abilities. Space is vast, complex, and beautiful, but not all learners have the same opportunity to experience or understand it fully. We aim to break down these barriers by using sound and music as a bridge. This project transforms planetary data such as distance, size, and type into musical elements, making space exploration a multi-sensory experience.

How It Works
This project converts planetary characteristics into sound, making space exploration accessible through music. Here's how the key elements work:

Size: The mass of a planet is represented by bass frequencies.
30 Hz: Represents massive planets.
50 Hz: Represents mid-sized planets.
75 Hz: Represents small planets.
Orbit Distance: The distance of a planet from its star is represented by cello notes.
C#: Indicates a closer distance.
D#: Indicates a mid-distance.
G#: Indicates a far distance.
Planet Type: The type of planet is represented by specific instruments.
Gas Giants: Represented by flute notes.
Habitable Planets: Represented by guitar sounds.

Example
When users click on Jupiter, they will hear:
Size: A bass sound at 30 Hz, reflecting Jupiter’s massive scale.
Distance: A cello note at D#, indicating its mid-distance from the Sun.
Type: Flute notes, signifying that Jupiter is a gas giant.

Benefits
This interactive approach caters to both sighted learners and visually impaired learners, making the platform inclusive for all. By combining a 3D environment for sighted users with auditory cues for visually impaired users, we provide an immersive experience where planetary features can be memorized through both visual and auditory stimuli.

For visually impaired learners, space exploration becomes a captivating auditory journey. For instance, when they click on the exoplanet Kepler-452b, they hear a guitar sound, signaling that it’s a habitable planet like Earth. Conversely, when they hear flute notes, they can easily recognize a gas giant. Additionally, they can deduce the size of the planet through the bass frequencies, offering them a new way to experience the universe.

What We Want to Achieve
Accessibility for All Learners: We aim to create an inclusive platform that allows both sighted and visually impaired learners to engage with and understand space science through multi-sensory experiences.
Immersive Learning Experiences: By combining visual and auditory elements, we hope to foster a deeper emotional connection to space, making learning enjoyable and memorable for all users.
Fostering Curiosity: We aim to spark curiosity about the universe and encourage learners to explore further, inspiring a lifelong interest in space science.
Breaking Barriers in Education: Our goal is to break down barriers between different types of learners, creating an inclusive learning environment that is enjoyable and accessible to all.
Supporting STEM Education: By offering a creative and inclusive learning method, we hope to contribute to educational advancements in STEM, particularly in ways that promote inclusivity and multi-sensory learning.
